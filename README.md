# **discourse-theme-hide-admins**

Hide admin(s) from the about page.

**Theme Summary**

Adds theme setting for a list of users. Those users will be hidden from the admin or modertor section of the about page.

Known problem: If you have only one admin or moderator and hide that user, there will be a admin/moderator heading with no users under it.
